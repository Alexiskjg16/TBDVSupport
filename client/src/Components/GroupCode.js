     Eventually I would like this website to be picked up by one or several organizations with specific support-
     group times and locations, where they can each be assigned a 'group code' that leads to a specific message
     board. That way names can still be anonymous if anyone else were to stumble across it, but the women on the
     site would have more of an idea of who was reading their posts and could be a little more open.
